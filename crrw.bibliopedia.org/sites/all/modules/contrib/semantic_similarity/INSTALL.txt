  * Drupal dependencies
  * Installation
  * Configuration


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

1. Install the Java Development Kit (JDK), which also includes the Java Runtime
   Environment (JRE). Visit http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp for
   installation information.

2. Install the R Project for Statistical Computing (later refered as R). Visit
   http://www.r-project.org for installation information.
   Note for Windows users: append the path to R binary to the system variable
   $PATH, then restart the system.

3. Install the required lsa (Latent Semantic Analysis) R package. Either:
   3.A. using the system's terminal:
        3.A.1. download the lsa package from a CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive
               Network) mirror
        3.A.2. type in the system's terminal:
               R CMD INSTALL --library=<path_to_R_library> <path_to_lsa_archive>
   Or:
   3.B. within R:
        3.B.1. type in the system's terminal:
               R
        3.B.2. within R's terminal, type in the following command:
               install.packages("lsa", lib = file.path("<path_to_R_library"))
               It will pop-up a list of mirrors in which you must select one. If
               you got no pop-up, you should abort the package installation and
               type chooseCRANmirror() first. If you were able to choose a
               mirror, then it will download and install the lsa package and its
               dependencies.

Note: the library path is usually:
  - linux:
    /usr/lib/R/ or /usr/local/lib/R/site-library/ or
    ~/R/i486-pc-linux-gnu-library/x.y/
  - windows:
    %PROGRAMFILES%\R\R-x.y.z\library\ or
    %USERPROFILE%\Documents\R\win-library\x.y\

Note 2: lsa package depends on rJava package wich in turn requires the JDK.
